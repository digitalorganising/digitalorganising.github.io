# Online organising

Today, work happens online. Regardless of whether workers are together in person, much of the subject of their labour lies in emails, calendars, virtual meetings, WhatsApp chats, presentations and spreadsheets. As trade unionists, our priority is to help workers to organise and build their power. This must happen where the workers are, and so it must happen online.

We already know well that there are no shortcuts in organising, and we must remind ourselves that this still applies to "digital organising": there is no online service that can build power; no data analysis that can substitute for a real collective voice; no social media communications strategy that can obviate the requirement for one-to-one conversations between workers. 

Our priority must be to give workers the ability to organise themselves in the digital workplace. We are wholly accustomed to staging interventions in the physical workplace - with noticeboards, with conversations, with pickets - but all too often we allow ourselves to consider the digital workplace to be a largely opaque entity under the employer's purview alone. Too many of our efforts are focused on the periphery of the online workplace, rather than inside it.

More optimistically, the digital workplace provides workers with organising opportunities that were unimaginable not long ago. The strategic work of mapping and charting a workplace is a prerequisite for a successful organising campaign but it is arduous and - with hostile employers - can even place workers at risk. Trade unions have successfully used analysis and visualisation of sectoral and national membership data to inform bargaining agendas and organising priorities, and there is huge potential for what workers can achieve if we are able to empower them to do this within their own workplaces.

## Web tools for organising

Bearing in mind the context outlined above, this project is an experiment to provide some of the aforementioned tools for workers. 

The tools are built with the requirements in mind that they must be...

### Secure

No data will ever leave the user's device through one of a tool; they are in control of where and when data is saved and who processes it; nobody else except the user has access to the data they input.

### Accessible

No tool can require anything in order to function other than a modern web browser; they are built following WCAG best practices where possible; they are non-technical and do not require technical expertise beyond basic workplace IT skills to use.

### Simple

One tool should solve one known problem; it should be straightforward to use and should not aim to be a complete product for workplace organising.

### Open

Workers should be able to "hack" and modify a tool if they want to: it must be open source and (in keeping with the security requirement) should not use any external server, database or other hosted service.
